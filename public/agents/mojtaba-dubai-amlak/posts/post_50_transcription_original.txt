Paradise is not a place, it's a state of mind. Some folks long for a getaway. But I'm right where I wanna stay. It's palm trees and crystal seas. Right here in the city breeze. I've got my toes in the sand. In my own private wonderland. From my terrace to the shore. Paradise is at my door. I'm takin' life real easy. Island vibes in my city. Don't need no plane to fly away. Got my slice of heaven every day. I'm in an island state of mind. Na-na-na-na, na-nai-nai-nai, na-nai-nai-nai, na-nai-nai-nai, na-nai-nai-nai, island vibes in my city. Don't need no plane to fly away. Got my slice of heaven every day. I'm in an island state of mind, oh-oh. Live the island state of mind- Hmm. At Damac Islands.
